# Knative Demos 
The purpose of this repo is to store all the code I plan to use to demo pieces of knative on GKE infrastructure that I plan to use 

## Demo script
There is a [Knative Demo.md](./Knative%20Demo.md) that contains a script I'm building that will run through some of the powerful features of knative and the process of setting all of them up in the way that I think is most powerful on GKE. It'll mostly follow the progression bellow unless things changes as I attempt to implement all of this. 

## gRPC applicaitons on knative

## Blue/Green Deployments

## gRPC autoscaling

## stack driver plugin

## Enabling custom domain

## Enabling cert management
